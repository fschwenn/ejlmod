This is the collection of python code for the conversion of publisher
information to INSPIRE xml format. All 'running' codes are in the active 
folder. The inactive folder contains special code for old journals or
code where the publisher format changed recently and the code is not yet 
updated.

This is not a ready-to-use package!
